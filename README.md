Hey there, nice to meet you! My name is **Korral**, but you might also know me as **lbracken812** or **Logan**!<br>
I'm a **14 year old student interested in technology** working on various fun projects!<br>
A lot of my contributions are private, but I still try to focus on keeping this world **open source**!

#### Contact

You can get in touch with me on [Discord](https://www.korral.me/discord).<br>
If you want to find out more about me or my projects you should have a look at [my website](https://www.korral.me/).

### My projects

Some of the projects I'm working on might not be listed here yet, but again, I am trying my hardest to keep my work open-sourced.

- [Poxx](https://www.poxx.me/), Protect and engage your Discord community!
- [???](https://lubr.neocities.org/), soon to be... Apps maybe?
- [Cyber Weekly](https://brackenfamilymn.wixsite.com/cyber), The best Cyber Security newsletter.
- _more to come soon..._

### My skills

I am able to plan, develop and maintain a full application stack by using the following (and more) technologies:

I am a huge fan of [Open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). Every day, the wold becomes closed source. That means, you can not tell what you are installing into your computer, and you can not take and edit small peices of it.

If you have any questions regarding my projects or technologies I use feel free to [get in touch](#contact).

### My goals

I want to figure out how to connect the world. I am really interested in technology, and I believe apps can change the world, and make everyone happy.

I also want to help the less fortunate. One of my main goals are to help others. When I help others, it makes me feel better.

I want this world to become a better place for everyone, for current and future residents. I enjoy making my contribution and hope for more possibilities in that regard.

#### Thanks!

So to finish this up, thank you so much for reading my little essay here! I greatly appreciate interested minds and curious souls! I hope you have an amazing day, see you around!

ðŸŽ‰

Cheers ~ Korral
